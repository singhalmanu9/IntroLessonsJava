		 * likely, you have no idea what you're doing.
		 * But that's ok! That's what this tutorial is for.
		 * 
		 * Let's get started! First, it is important for
		 * any programmer to learn how to output a message.
		 * The easiest way to do this is by using the System class.
		 * The details aren't important right now, so try
		 * typing in System.out.println("Hello World!"); in underneath this comment.
		 * Comments are writings and notes that the complier doesn't read
		 * so it's great for putting notes! The comment is all of the stuff
		 * inside the slash-stars. Try it!
		 */
		
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
		
		/*
		 * Try running the program now. You can do this by clicking the green
		 * arrow above the editor window. Select this project name, and you're off!
		 * 
		 * After running the program, you should see Hello World! in a box 
		 * called the Console. The console collects the output from
		 * the program and displays it here. Now try replacing "Hello World!" by
		 * your name. Run the program again and see the computer call out
		 * your name. You're on your way to becoming a programmer!
